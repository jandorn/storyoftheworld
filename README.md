<p style="color:#ED203D;">THIS PROJECT CURRENTLY IS IN DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE RELEASED SOON</p>

## About

Welcome to [Story of the World](https://storyofthe.world), an open-source project dedicated to making the history of our planet's diverse nations engaging and accessible. This interactive world map is a gateway to exploring the unique stories of every country on earth. By clicking on any country on the map, you are greeted with a popup that presents a well-crafted summary of the nation's history, crafted to be informative and fun to read.

The project is a growing repository of narratives with a unique approach: only one country's history is released every week. The website features a countdown timer that indicates when the next country will be released. While upcoming countries' histories are locked, past releases remain accessible, allowing for a cumulative experience of world history at your fingertips.

## Newsletter

Stay updated on the release of each country by subscribing to the weekly newsletter. As a subscriber, you'll be the first to know when a new country's history goes live on the site. This newsletter is not just an alert but an invitation to witness history as it is revealed, week by week. Sign up through the website and join a community of history buffs eagerly awaiting each new story.

## Contribute

I believe in the power of collaboration to enrich this historical journey. If you're passionate about history, web development, or storytelling, your contributions are welcome here. Whether it's suggesting new features, improving the user interface, or contributing to the historical content, your pull requests can help shape the Story of the World. I encourage you to dive into the code, offer improvements, and be a part of this evolving project.

## Techstack

The journey through time is powered by a constellation of modern technologies. I've built the experience using [Astro](https://astro.build), ensuring a lightning-fast, SEO-friendly, and delightful user interface. The aesthetics and animations are crafted using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for its utility-first approach and [GSAP](https://gsap.com) for smooth, performant animations. The interactive map at the core of our experience is driven by [D3.js](https://d3js.org), providing a seamless and dynamic user interaction model. This stack was chosen for its scalability, performance, and developer experience, ensuring that Story of the World is as enjoyable to build as it is to browse.
